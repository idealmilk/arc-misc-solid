          so he passes this attitude on to his collabora-tors and followers. At
          these various points - in designing, com-missioning, teaching,
          speaking - he betrays what could be described as an expressionist
          approach, if a label is requireD .his work is full of devices that
          visualize an emotional and non-figurative, non-literal response to a
          brieF .but the expressionist tag is likely to be as mislead-ing as it
          is helpfuL. while he admires artists such as mark rothko and franz
          kline, both key participants in the heyday of american abstract
          expressionism, so he also draws on other art forms, from street
          imagery and elsewherE .he doesn't become a musician or a documentary
          artist as a result of these influences, so it would also seem sensible
          to beware of too easily labelling the work expressionisT .[A ta which,
          after all, can and has been applied to much of 2oth-century Western
          art.]
